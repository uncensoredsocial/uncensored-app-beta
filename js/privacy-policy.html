            <h2>3. Data we do collect</h2>
            <p>
              To make the Service function at all, we need to collect some
              limited information that you provide directly or that is generated
              by your use of the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Account information</h3>
            <p>When you create an account, we may collect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A username (handle) and display name</li>
              <li>An optional profile picture or banner image</li>

            <h3>3.2 User-generated content</h3>
            <p>
              When you use UncensoredSocial, you may create or upload
              content, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Posts and comments</li>
              <li>Images, videos, and other media you choose to upload</li>

              This content is stored so that it can be displayed within the
              Service. You can delete your posts, and we will remove them from
              the live Service (subject to caching and backups, as explained
              below).
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Authentication & session data</h3>
            <p>
              To keep you logged in and secure your account, we may store:

            <ul>
              <li>

            <p>
              UncensoredSocial offers direct messages (“DMs”) that are designed
              to be
              <strong>end-to-end encrypted</strong>. This means:

                of your DMs.

              keeping your devices and login credentials safe.
